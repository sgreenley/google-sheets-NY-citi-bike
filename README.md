**Background** 

Citi Bike is the largest bike-share program in the United States, with 20,000 bikes and over 1,300 pick-up stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Jersey City. As stated on their website, the service was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, offering a fun and affordable way to get around town. Users can sign up for annual membership, or buy a short-term pass through the Citi Bike app. Once they’ve joined, they simply locate a nearby bike, ride around as they please, and return it to a nearby station once they’re done

**Assigment**

Your mission is to analyze data collected by Citi Bike and help key stakeholders to make smart, data-driven decisions based on the insights you uncover. Here’s what you’ll seek to investigate:

 1. What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for NY Citi Bike rental?
 2. How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
 3. Which age group rents the most bikes?
 4. How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week?
 5. Does user age impact the average bike trip duration?
